ðŸ”¥ Congratulations, your cluster should be up in a few minutes ðŸš€

You can check the status of your cluster with 
    clusterctl describe cluster -n {{ .Release.Name }} {{ .Release.Name }}

As soon as the ControlPlane status is True you can grab the kubeconfig with
    clusterctl get kubeconfig  -n {{ .Release.Name }} {{ .Release.Name }} > ~/.kube/{{ .Release.Name }}

For a quick sanity check run 
    KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/{{ .Release.Name }} kubectl get pods -A
